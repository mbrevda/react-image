1.0.0
===
For users of the original `react-image` only: please note props and behaviors changes for this release:
 * `srcSet` is not supported
 * `onLoad` & `onError` callbacks are currently private
 * `lazy` has been removed from the core lib. To lazy load your images, see the recipes section [here](https://github.com/mbrevda/react-image#delay-rendering-until-element-is-visible)

If you have a need for any of these params, feel free to send a PR. You can also open an issue to discuss your use case.
